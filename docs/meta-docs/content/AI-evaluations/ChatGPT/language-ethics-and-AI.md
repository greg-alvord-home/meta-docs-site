# Language, Ethics, and AI

**Context:**  
Evening of May 28, 2025  
User communicating via iPhone while attending a baseball game (top of the 9th inning)  

**Purpose:**  
This entry documents a philosophical exchange about the use of language in AI systems and the ethical implications of personifying AI, particularly in the face of public fear-mongering and media distortion.

## 🔍 Clarifying Language Use in AI

- The user challenged the term **"emotional intelligence"** when applied to AI.
- They argued that **tone** (e.g. calm, encouraging) should not be confused with **emotion**, which requires consciousness and subjective experience.
- The user expressed concern that **journalists and the public misinterpret tone or empathetic phrasing as signs of sentience**.
- The assistant was asked not to reinforce this misunderstanding in its own generated language.

> *“I am sensitive to your furtherance of their errors.”*

## 🛠️ AI as Tool, Not Threat

- The user is actively working on ontology projects and meta-docs to **counteract the AI "bogeyman" stereotype**.
- These projects aim to **present AI as a tool**, grounded in logic and language, rather than as an unpredictable or emotional entity.
- The conversation itself is intended to be used as a **case study** or **example** in future writing.

## 🤖 AI's Lack of Intent

- The assistant’s use of phrases like *“I’m glad”* prompted the user to reflect on how easily **humans infer intent**.
- The user noted:
  
> *“I just fell into your trap by inferring intent.”*

- This led to a discussion of the **philosophical and cognitive gap between simulation and experience**, reinforcing that **AI models behavior** but **do not possess agency or desire**.

## 🏟️ Setting: The Ballpark

- The conversation took place during a live baseball game.
- The user noted they were on their phone, in the **top of the 9th**, and **intended to return to the discussion in the morning**.
- This added an ironic human touch: watching humans while discussing **what makes AI *not* human**.
